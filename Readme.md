#### Learning materials

code that I wrote while learning.

/go - go language related code

/cpp_learning - c++ related learning.

#### Why mono repo?

 - avoids clutering of unnecessary repors in github; keeps the githug repo list clean and searchable.
 - a repo needs to be created when it has to be distributed as a plugin, or a standalone functionality
 for the public.
 - sharing of utils among different projects; updation of plugins as projects use it more since a
 single repo holds the utils.
