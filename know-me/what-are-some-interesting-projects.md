## What are some Interesting projects that I worked on?

### BookMyShow DIY project

The project was about creating a Content Management Software for Users to host their events without having to connect with Bookmyshow Operations. When the project came to me, after another team failed to succeed in the project. My task was to hire a team and start the project afresh. But no Project management support was provided for an year.

I grew the team from 2 members to 9 members. Defined the product. Finally in a matter of 7 months, the team could achive more that the Managements expectations.

We created a custom microsite generator with a templating tool, using which general public can create their even microsite and make it look different from any other project.

The whole application was micro services based, with 5 back end services and 4 front end services deployed using Vagrant Docker  combination.

This was an all round experience for me, Product definition, Leadership, Architecting, Back-End develping and Recruiting.

### Offer Engine

As part of the above project, a rule based offer engine was developed that can be customised to accept any combination of conditions for satisfaction of offers.

### Extract Transform Load of Analytics data.

Writing the whole Analytics V1 data of Engagement HQ a community engagement software to V2 data. Pure mysql was used to tranform the data with huge business logic and computation logics written on Mysql to improve on performance. The Data Set ranged from 3 - 17 Gb per Analytics table data per client.
