## Interesting bug mash

- In Healthi, once the package recommendation module was not recommending the expected Package. Then I debuged through 2 predicting algorithms to identify the reason behind the behavior. Suggested two solutions, one an entirely new algorithm another an improvement on the existing algorithm,. Improved the package recommendation algorithm to Lab Test level accuracy.

- After another engineer conducted a rails 5.2  version update, the uploaded files becuase missing. Identified the issue. Wrote script to link back to the old files.
