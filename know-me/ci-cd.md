## Please describe your CI/CD experience.

On the Code quality side, I have always been using the pre-commit hooks that I download from pre-commit.com. For deployment I have created some docker scripts. But I  always have the DevOps teams who take care of deployment, and they set up everything and provide me a one click interface in Bamboo from Atlassian / Jenkins. So my knowledge is limited.
