## You received an implementation of a feature proposal and you see that the author has spent a significant amount of time on it. You don't agree with the way it was implemented and designed. How do you approach this situation, and how do you communicate with the contributor?

If this happens, we have to take collective responsibility and more engineers have to step in and work towards correcting the issue and releasing with no or minimal differences from the actual ETA.
This situation can be avoided, by initial architecture evaluation among peers. After architecture sign off from senior engineers, keeping a WIP PR, which colleagues review intermittently and thoroughly. These steps avoid the above mentioned scenario and maintains a collective responsibility from the very beginning.
We could be on the receiving side as well, so treat the engineer the way we want to be treated. First understand why was the design choice made. May be once explained, we might stand corrected. If still our observations hold true, then work with the engineer to help him understand and sort the issue. Share the work for a faster redressal. May be request more engineers with some spare time to join.
