## Do you have any remote working experience? What are pros and cons of working remotely?

- I have done remote work from the beginning of my career. As a consultant I worked from home between 2009 Sept - 2010 Mar.
- Mar 2011 - Apr - 2012 - completely remote team in Bangthetable.
- Sept 2012 - Apr 2013 - working remotely , with company in Bangthetable, Bangalore.
- Jun 2014 - June 2016 - Bookmyshow. 50 % Work from home every month. I managed a team as well in that mode. (Team also had similar facility. Only my team in Bookmyshow enjoyed it because I negotiated it from the management. It worked out well for the project.)
- July 2016 - Present - Complete work from home. Except for a few engineers working remote, most others are in office.

Cons:

* Emotional instability, due to lack of human interactions. Solution: Co Working spaces.
* When the whole team is not remote, the remote engineers find it difficult as the culture will give way to proxy project discussions, which will omit remote engineers. Solution: Work with an entirely remote team.

Pros:

* Cut down on travel time. Which can be used for productive activities.
* Better availability for work. Not becoming late, as well as because we are armed with our tools (Laptop , Internet and power backup) we can swing into action in case of an event in the product we are working on.
* There is no better distraction free mode than remote work. In office, proxy discussions and distractions are more. While those are very important social interactions, if we can separate it from work, the more productive we get.
* Remote workers are well organised in terms of work.
* Most of the remote jobs also have flexible hours, so we can make ourselves available for our personal needs and still work completely. Lesser leaves, same or more productivity.
* Better documentation - currently a lot of details about design choices are lost because those are taken over by verbal discussions. When engineers move on, or even when people forget with time, those information are lost, while those are captured in writing when systematic meetings happen in remote work. MOMâ€™s(Minutes of meetings) are common among organised remote workers.

Environmental, social, economical importance of Remote work.

* Reduce pollution. Reduce cluttering of cities. Distributed township development, Employment opportunity improvements for other jobs in wider areas. Etc.
