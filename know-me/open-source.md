## Do you have an open source project that you own or contributed to that you feel particularly proud about?

I have some Github repos that I did in my free time. But nobody is using them. Some of them are still in use by me. Currently I am working on an open source project for a simple and effective Ecom system in Golang + Mysql with documentation, so that companies can use them for building in-house ecom on top of the library. Many of the questions companies face while developing ecom are solved in that library. I have been doing ecom since four years and I want to create a library that everyone can customise and use.

This is an index of some interesting works I have done in github:
