## What do you think about Test Driven Development? Do you benefit from using this technique? Why?

I am a fan of test driven development. TDD helps me develop bottom-up rather than using a Top-down approach. A Top down approach is, when we look at the problem from an input to output manner. In that fashion, software tends to be written in procedural paradigm. While the basic character of TDD is to identify the smallest testable unit. Then write the test case for that(Unit Tests). Make it fail. Write the code for it as a method. Make it Green. when we achieve the encapsulation + Single Responsibility + pipeline styled code, we can do the refactoring with confidence. This is called the Red-Green-Refactor pattern using TDD.

* It Elevates my confidence in coding.
* Coding quality and readability improves.
* Test itself acts as a documentation.
* Further development without breaking of features becomes easier. Integration tests are a plus.
